# Resume Builder

This is a resume builder application, it includes editing of sections and the ability to print the resume.

Working with React was awesome like always. I have grown to like the SPA model even more due to it's snappiness and no-reload ability, especially in this situation where a reload would make building a resume take ages.

### Future Features
- Ability to re-organize and add sections at will
- Different templates to work from
